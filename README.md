# STD

STD, a collection of standards to make how exactly you should do things for optimal compatability with all of our tools.

## `proposals`

This folder contains standards which haven't been implemented yet, and are thus still subject to flux.

Modifications can be performed by PR reasonably arbitrarily subject to some debate. This should be considered the "good idea" bucket.

## `standards`

This folder contains standards which are _implemented_.

These matter for compatibility, so technical modifications to them can and should be subject to discussion.

PRs can and should be made before code is complete, as technical debates may ensue that require the code to be changed.

However, the acceptance of a PR must only occur _after_ code is already in the respective target repositories to implement the PR.
